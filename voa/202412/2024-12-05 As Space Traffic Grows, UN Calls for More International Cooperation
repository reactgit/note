as the amount of space traffic continues to grow the united nations is calling for incresed international cooperation to improve safety
continued  deployment of satellites and sharp increases in space debris  over the years have resulted in the crowding of low earth orbit
space experts and industry leaders say this has created safety risks that were/will version/worsen if the problem is not dealt with
a un gathering of experts in oct called for more sharing of information about orbital space objects  as well as creation of international process to follow and manage them 
the meeting was organized by the un's official/office for outer space afairs
data from the american based company xx aerospace sugggests  there are more than 14 thousand satellites around the world in low earth orbit
that number includes about 3500 satellites that are currently inactive reuters news agency reports
in addition there are about 120 million pieces of orbital debris leftover from spacecraft launches  crashes or other causes
only a few thousand of those are large enough  to follow or track
there is no time to lose on space traffic coordnation the director of un's official/office for outter space affairs xx told reuters
she added with so many objects being launched into space we have to do everthing we can  to ensure space safety    and that means  facility/facilitating the sharing information between operators 
xx explaid that such coordination  should invole both public and private organizitions
the goal is to take steps to avoid crashes between space objects orbiting in low earth orbit
she added that these area of space must remain safe to prevent costly difficulties to tecknologies that  drive worldwide   communication navigation and sientific  exploration
currently there is no centralised system to help prevent such problems
it has also been diffcult for organizitions to agree on a set of guidelines (in that)/(aimed at) prevent/improving in saftety  in low earth orbit
while some countries are willing to  share data others object because of  security or privacy concerns
there have been serval examples of these issues over the past year
a chinese launcher rocket exploded in august creating thousands of pieces of debris in low earth orbit
in june a unused russian satelliate exploded realese thousands little/mental pieces
that inncident forced astronauts (some of)/(on the) international space station to briefly take shouter/shelter
low earth orbit is the most crowded area of space
this is because it offers a balance between caused/cost and proximity make it popuplar target for the quickly growing private space industry
it is estimated that many more satellites  tens of thousands more will enter low earth orbit in the  coming years
one prediction by canada beased space tracking company xx  space suggests the possible financial risk of space object collisions is likely to reach 556  million dollars over five years
xx chief executive yy told reuters the situation had reached a critical point or stablishing rules to cover space objects in low earth orbit
xx noted that spacex's star link is launching thousands of satellites per year  and china and others are preparing to follow
such expansion could threanten the low copacity of objects in low earth orbit said xx
