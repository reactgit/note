in this weeks episode of everyday grammer we are going to help understand the difference between then simple past and the present perfect
english learners ofen confused these two verb tenses
let's start with an example, can you tell the difference between these two sentences
sentence 1 i saw the movie
sentence 2 i have seen the movie
sentence 1 uses the simple past tense, sentence 2 uses the present perfect tense
i saw the movie and i have seen the movie both refer to the action that was finished in the past
but there is one important difference, i saw the movie suggests you saw the movie at a specific time in the past
i have seen the movie suggests you saw the moive at an unkown time in the past
use the simple past to talk about finished action that happened  at a specific time
for example i went| out with my friends last night
the ad verb last night is not required but it does help clarify that enent happened at a specific time  
that's the easy part
now let's talk about the present perfect
you form the present perfect by using have or has followed by the past partcible form of the verb
for example i have graduated from college
the present perfect confuses english learners because it refers to a past action
it is also called present perfect because speaker use it to stress importance of a past event in the present
the sentence "i have graduated from college" emphsis the present effect of a past event graduation, the exact time of graduation is not important
there are 4 more common situations that require the present perfect
first it can express a repeated action
when the action happened more than one time in the past, use the present perfect  for example
i have seen the movie 3 times
second it is common to use the present perfect with the words for and since
for and since are ad verbs that tell about the duration of activity
they answer the question how long for example
i have study english for long time 
third the negative ad verb never requires the present perfect you can say
i have never been to france
you would not say
i did never go to france
finally when asking a question in the present perfect use ever as 
have you ever win the lottery|
use tip pay close attenion to ever, ever give ? or clues about which verb tense you should use
a good way to practice the present perfect is to ask english speaking friend if he/she has ever done something
have you ever flown in airplane
or
have you ever seen the xxx
