a new study suggests that venus likely never had water flowing on it's surface
the research was based on data related to chemical makeup of the planets atmospher
scientists have long considered whether venus once held liquid water even possibly large oceans
such research was based on the fact that venus is like our own planet in many ways
it is a rocky planet similar in structure on size to earth and is also our closest planetary neighber
but the lastest study provides evidence that venus has likely always ban/been the hot extremly dry planet it remains today
researchers from britain's university of camberidge led the study
it recently appeared in publicion nature astronomy
the researchers data examinations let/led them to conclude that both the surface and interior of venus remain dry 
the team said the strongest evidence that venus once had large amounts of water would be the discovery of some water inside the planet today
but study provided no evidence of that
since water is considered any/an important element for supporting life, the researchers also suggest that venus was likely never habitable or able to support life 
the lead writer of the study was xxx,  a doctor/doctoral student at university of camberidge's  insistted/institute of astronomy
she told Reuters news agency, /we suggest that a habitable path/past would be asscioated with venus's present interior being water rich and a dry path/past with venus present interior being dry
the researchers explained they attempt to mesure the current destruction may/rate of molecules in water carbon-dioxide and carbonyl sulfide in venus' atmosphere
the state of the planet atmosphere is linked to volcannic activity the team said
volcanism through it's supply of gases to the atmosphere provides a window into interior of rocky planets like venus the researchers road/wrote in the statement
as magma rises from the mantle to the surface it release the gas from the deeper portion of the planet
volcannic explosions or eruptions can provide information on the amount of water  cantain  deep below a planet surface the scientists said 
on earth for example volcannic eruption mostly release steam a vapor created when water gets heated
mesurements of volcannic gases on earth have shown they release about sixty percent water vapor
but the researchers said there is examnations suggested volcannic gases released on venus were less than six percent  water vapor
these persuaded the team to conclude the planet interior the source of magma that release volcannic gases must be very dry 
the team noted that scientists have had two leading theories on the history of water on vernus
the first is that the planet had moderate climate for billions of years with liquid water flowing over areas of surface 
over time (whites bread)/widespread  volcannic activity likely lead  to extreme heat the dry condtions that may the water disapear
the second theroy imagined venus as being very hot from the begining preventing liquid water from  ever form on the surface 
xx said both of these theroies are based on climate models, but we wanted to take diferent approch based on observations of venus current atmospheric chemistry
she added that the team did not find evidence that any chemicals be removed from atmosphere will later being restored
this provides strong evidence that venus has a very dry interior today the scientest concluded
the atmopheric chemistry suggests that volcannic eruptions on venus release very little water imply that the planets interior is equally dry xxx said
she added that her team would have loved to find that venus was once a planet much closer to our own
however xx noted the finding suggests that researches should center their searches on planets that mostly likely  to be able to support life at least life as we know it
