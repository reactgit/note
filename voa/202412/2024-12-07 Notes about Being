hello this week on ask teacher we answer a question from xx in parkstan about a form of word being in english
dear teacher
i am always confused when it comes to the usage of being
thank you
xx 
i am happy to answer this question xx
let's start by considering a basic way we use the verb be in english
we commonly use this verb to link or join a subject with it's description
the description were often be a noun or adjective
the flowing two examples  show this
that man is a farmer
that man is rich
expanding on this use of the verb being we can call a description of how a person feels or expericens his or her life ad state of being
a state of being can last for a short or a long time
however a state of being is longer than a momentary feeling
the flowing examples show this usage
in retiremen her state of being became more relaxed
his state of being has not be good in recent month
we can also use the word being to begin a  description
this can help us describe something or someone in one sentence instead of two
for example we could use two sentences to describe a man who dosn't speak much with other people
xx was someone who spoke very little
he sat quietly while others did the talking 
but if we use the word being we can express this idea in on sentence, as the following example
being a man of few words xx sat quietly while others did the talking 
here is another example of changing a description from  two sentence to one sentence
xx was very tall, that is why he decide to play basketball insteat of football
being very tall xx decide to play basketball insteat of football
we can also use the word being combined with the noun  or adjective  that follows it as the subject of  sentence  consider the following examples
being a parent is helped me better understand my own parents
being open to critisim will help you improve your work
in these examples, the phrases "being a parent " and  "being open to critisim" are the subject of the sentence
lastly we can use the word being  as a noun to describe a highly inteligent form of life
humans are beings and somewhere in the universe other inteligent being  might exist
for our readers and listeners what are your questions about voa
we'd like to hear from you
