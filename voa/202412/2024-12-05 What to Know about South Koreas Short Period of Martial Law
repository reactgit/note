south korea's parliament moved to impeach president xx after he declared martial law and sent the troops into the streets on tuesday night
for several hours armed forces with helicopters and armored vehicles surrounded the parliament
lawmakers had to climb walls to get into the builing and used the fire extinguishers to hold up/off the troops
the lawmakers who were able to reenter the building rejected the xx's  martial law declaration with 190 to 0 vote
18 lawmakers from xx's party also voted against the declaration
the vote force xx to lift martial law about 6 hours after it began
opposition parties then began the process of impeachment 
impeachment is a way for lawmakers to charge public official with crime while they were/are in office
impeaching xx requires the support of 2/3 of national assembly and at least 6/9 constitutional court justices
the liberal opposition democratic party holds majority in the 300 see/seat parliament and has called for xx resignation
a vote on the impeachment motion could be hold as early as friday  democratic party lawmaker xx said
xx ordered martial law without warning in a the speech late tuesday
he promised to remove  ??/anti-state force he said were planing rebel
he accused the main opposition party of supporting north korea
xx gave no direct evidence when he pointed to  north korea as threatening force
xx has long held that a hard line is the only way to stop the north and/from following through on it's nuclear threats againt south
in the late 1980s several south korea strongmen spoke of the threat from north when struggling to control protesters and  political opponents in the south
as presdent xx has struggled to get his proposals  through  the oppositon controlled parliament
at the same time xx and his wife have faced  charges of corruption
south korea's constitution gives the president power to use the militry to keep order,   and/in wartime  war-like situations or other comparable national emergency states
that can include suspending civil rights and temporarily limiting the powers of courts  and goverment agencies
but is also gives the national assembly power to lift the declaration with majority vote
some experts say the way xxx declared martial law went far beyond his lawful powers
the constitution does not permit a president to use the militry to suspend parliment 
and many question whether the country really faces situation comparable to war
the opposition said xx's actions were illegal and  unconstitutional
the sudden declaration was also opposed by the leader of xx own conservative party 
xx called the decision wrong and  promised to stop it with the people
south korea became democraticy only in the late 1980s  and miliary intervention surveil/civilian fairs is still sensitive subject
south koreas /(were in) shock with the actions
and many expressed suprise and worry  on social media over xx's anouncement
