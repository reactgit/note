the california department of fish and wildlife has released a proposed plan to protect the states femas/famous joshua trees
enviromentalists say the trees are threatened by wildfires, human devolopment and climate change
and early version of the plan calls for avoiding or reducing direct and indirect effects of overgrazing insect-killing chemical use and aff-roading activity
the plan advises moving trees when projects require their removal or could harm them
it also cause/calls for identifying and protecting lanes/lands with/where the trees could survive if the climate in sudden/southern california becomes drier and hotter
in many ways it's a good comprehensive plan of thin/things we need to do if western joshua trees is going to survive the very very difficult decades ahead said xx
he is conservation director with center for  biological diversity based into yyy
the none profit group asked the california goverment in 2019 to list the western joshua trees as threatened  under the states indangous/endangered species that/act
the conservation plan is a requirement by the western joshua tree conservation not/act
california law makers past the act last year
it is the fist law in the state to protect a species from the threats of climate change
the law also ban/bars anyone from killing damaging or removeing a tree without the state's permissoion
the proposed plan lists ways to help identify line/land that should be recognized as most important for conservation
this includes large areas with joshua trees or areas with a high density of health and adult trees
the plan suggests placeing restrictions on areas where there is no risk of such threats as fires invasive plans and animals devoloment and where pollinators and (sea breading)/seed-spreading animals exsist
it aims to identify this line/land by december 2025 and place permanebt restrictions on 70 percent of them by 2033
the plan also cause/calls an/on land managers and (wildby for girls)wildfire-workers to create methods to reduce and fight wildfires that threatened the trees and lessen facts/effects for/from realbility/rehabilitating burned areas
that includes protecting trees replanting them planting ohter /native species  and controlling invasive ones
the proposed plan says it's a affectiveness and the survive of  the trees or mainly depend on wether reductions can be made in release of heat-trapping gases 
such emissions come mainly from burning coal oil and gas
xx said climate change could detroy most if not all of the areas where trees live if the situation does't change 
if emissions are limited as planed xx said we have a very good chance  of saving the species if all the things outlined in this plan are carried out and primarily thats doing all we can to protect as many as possible
approval from california fish and game commision is nessary for the proposed plan to going to affect
