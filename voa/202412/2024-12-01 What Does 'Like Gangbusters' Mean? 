With a new project, you may want to start with energy and excitement. 
If that is the case, you could say you want to start like gangbusters.
To start like gangbusters means you start a project on the right foot - an exciting one! 


You begin with energy, speed, and attention-getting success.

Let's hear some examples:

She works like gangbusters and gets the job done quickly.
The wildflowers are spreading like gangbusters.
We can use this expression to describe something that starts with a lot of enthusiasm. 
It can also mean someone or something is having great effect -- usually in a good way. Whatever the attempt is, it is successful.
To start something like gangbusters can also mean it involved great force or aggressiveness. For example, the partners worked like gangbusters to open their business before their rivals in the city.
Like gangbusters can simply mean something is growing very fast. For example, if the economy is growing like gangbusters, it is growing very fast.
Sometimes we add the phrasal verb "come on," making the expression to come on like gangbusters. The expression to come on like gangbusters can also mean to work hard and in an energetic, forceful manner to get something done.
Here are some examples:
When I gave the lesson to my students, they came on like gangbusters to try to solve the mystery.
The new employee came on like gangbusters during her first few months on the job.
But why gangbusters?
As a noun, gangbuster is a term for a law-enforcement officer who breaks up organized crime. Gangbusters often use forceful or aggressive means.
Word experts say the expression like gangbusters comes from a popular radio show called Gang Busters broadcast in the United States from 1935 to 1957. This crime-fighting radio drama started with a lot of noise and excitement - police sirens, screams, gun fire and exciting music.
Gangbuster is also an adjective. It can describe something that is excellent or successful. For example, experts are reporting of a gangbusters housing market in rural areas.
It can also describe someone who is energetic or eager to do something. For example, if someone asks you to volunteer during the weekend you can say, "I'm not really gangbusters over that idea." However, this usage is not as common as to come on like gangbusters.
And if you do not want to use gangbusters, you could say you started something with a bang. To start or begin something with a bang means you start in an exciting and noticeable way. You can also say to be back with a bang.
Here's an example using that expression:
The singer took a year off. But with her new album, she's back with a bang.
